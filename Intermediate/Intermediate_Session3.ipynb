    "## Working with files(.txt,.csv) - Feb25\n",
    "### File modes\n",
    "- To open the files, use `open(filename, mode)` function\n",
    "- Open modes:\n",
    "    - r: read (Read only. File must exist)\n",
    "    - w: write (Overwrites file. Creates if not exists.)\n",
    "    - a: append (Adds to end. Creates if not exists.)\n",
    "    - r+: read + write (No truncation. File must exist.)\n",
    "    - w+: write + read (Truncates file.)\n",
    "    - a+: append + read (Writes at end.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Manager\n",
    "- With manual way, the files remains open until explicitly closed with `f.close()`. \n",
    "- The file remains \"open\" in memory. It might get corrupted, blank, or locked so other programs can't touch it.\n",
    "To cope with that, we use **Context Manager**\n",
    "- The `with` keyword is a Wrapper. No matter what happens (success or crash), it closes the file automatically.\n",
    "- e.g. `with open (os.path.join(\"resources\",\"pro_notes.txt\"), \"w\") as file:`\n",
    "- `with` provides a safe exit; used with I/P-O/P bound object\n",
    "- `__enter__()`: Called when execution enters the with block.\n",
    "- `__exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Called when execution leaves the with block (either normally or due to an exception).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading from files\n",
    "- Always give relative path - a relative file path specifies a file's location based on the current working directory\n",
    "- read() vs readlines()\n",
    "    - read() - read all at once (one big string)\n",
    "    - readlines() - we read file as a List of Lines(line by line)\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV & JSON\n",
    "- Structured data\n",
    "    - **CSV** (Comma Separated Values): Simple, row-column data (like Excel)\n",
    "    - **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation): Nested key-value data (like Dictionaries)\n",
    "- Always open file with newline=\"\" like `open(..., newline=\"\")` when writing CSVs\n",
    "- Reading a csv:\n",
    "    - `with open(os.path.join(\"resources\", \"students.csv\"), \"r\", newline=\"\") as file:`\n",
    "        - `reader = csv.reader(file)`\n",
    "- Writing/Appending to csv:\n",
    "    - `with open(os.path.join(\"resources\",\"students.csv\"), \"a\", newline=\"\") as file:`\n",
    "        - `writer = csv.writer(file)`\n",
    "- JSON files\n",
    "    - json.load(file): Read JSON file --> Python Dict.\n",
    "    - json.dump(data, file): Python Dict --> Write JSON file\n",
    "- dump vs dumps\n",
    "    - dump = File (Dump it into the hard drive).\n",
    "    - dumps = String (Dump it into a String variable).\n",
    "- load vs loads\n",
    "    - load = read JSON encoded data from a file and convert it into a Python dictionary\n",
    "    - loads = parse a valid JSON string and convert it into a Python Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
