    "## List Comprehension\n",
    "- tool for creating lists by iterating over an iterable and optionally applying a condition\n",
    "- concise, readable code that performs transformations or filtering\n",
    "- Syntax: `new_list = [expression for member in iterable]`\n",
    "    - e.g. `num_list = [x*2 for x in nums]`\n",
    "- add conditional logic to a list comprehension by including an `if` statement within the comprehension\n",
    "    - e.g. `evens = [i for i in range(20) if i % 2 == 0]`\n",
    "- faster than a `for` loop because it’s optimized for performance by Python’s internal mechanisms\n",
    "- **Dictionary comprehensions** are similar, with the additional requirement of defining a key\n",
    "    - Syntax: `{key: value for item in list}`\n",
    "    - e.g. `{number: number * number for number in range(10)}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### When not to use Comprehensions\n",
    "- Warning: If your logic is super complex (more than 2 if statements), do not use a comprehension. Go back to a normal loop. \n",
    "Code is for humans to read first, computers second.\n",
